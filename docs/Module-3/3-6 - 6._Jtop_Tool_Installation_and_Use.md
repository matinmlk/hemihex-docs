# 6. Jtop Tool Installation and Use

## 6. Installing and Utilizing the Jtop Tool

This section provides instructions for installing the Jtop tool, a utility for monitoring NVIDIA Jetson systems. It also covers verifying the installation of key system components such as CUDA, cuDNN, and OpenCV, which are typically pre-installed with the Jetson OS image.

### Jtop Installation

To install Jtop and begin monitoring your Jetson system, particularly for CPU usage and other system metrics, follow these steps:

1.  **Update and Upgrade System Packages:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get full-upgrade
    ```

2.  **Install Prerequisites (curl and nano):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install curl
    sudo apt install nano
    ```

3.  **Install pip (Python Package Installer):**
    ```bash
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    sudo python3 get-pip.py
    ```

4.  **Install jetson-stats (which includes jtop):**
    ```bash
    sudo pip3 install jetson-stats
    ```

5.  **Launch Jtop:**
    ```bash
    jtop
    ```

### Verifying Installed System Components

The Jetson OS image comes pre-loaded with several critical development components, including JetPack, CUDA, cuDNN, and OpenCV. These installations also include examples that can be found at the following paths:

*   **TensorRT:** `/usr/src/tensorrt/samples/`
*   **CUDA:** `/usr/local/cuda-11.4/samples/`
*   **cuDNN:** `/usr/src/cudnn_samples_v8/`
*   **VisionWorks:**
    *   `/usr/share/visionworks/sources/samples/`
    *   `/usr/share/visionworks-tracking/sources/samples/`
    *   `/usr/share/visionworks-sfm/sources/samples/`
*   **OpenCV:** `/usr/share/opencv4/samples/`

#### Checking CUDA Installation

While CUDA version 11.4 is pre-installed on the Jetson Orin Nano, the `nvcc -V` command may not function immediately without proper environment variable configuration. The `vim` tool is included with the OS and can be used to edit these variables.

First, verify the presence of `nvcc` in the CUDA binary directory:
```bash
ls /usr/local/cuda/bin
```

If `nvcc` exists, proceed to edit your `.bashrc` file to add CUDA to your system's `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:

1.  **Open `.bashrc` for editing:**
    ```bash
    sudo vim ~/.bashrc
    ```
    *   **Note on `vim` usage:**
        *   Press `Esc` to return to command mode.
        *   Press `I` to enter insert mode for text input.

2.  **Add the following lines at the end of the file:**
    ```bash
    export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```

3.  **Save and Exit `vim`:**
    *   After exiting insert mode with `Esc`, type `:` to enter command mode.
    *   Type `wq` and press `Enter` to save and exit.
    *   Use `q` to exit without saving, or `q!` for a forced exit.

4.  **Apply the changes:**
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

5.  **Verify CUDA installation:**
    Now, execute `nvcc -V` again to confirm the successful configuration.

    ```bash
    beckhans@Jetson:~$ nvcc -V
    ```

#### Checking OpenCV Installation

OpenCV version 4.5.4 is typically pre-installed on Jetson systems. You can verify its installation and retrieve its version number using the following command:

```bash
pkg-config opencv4 --modversion
```

A successful installation will display the installed version number, such as `4.5.4`.

#### Checking cuDNN Installation

cuDNN is also pre-installed on the Jetson Nano, complete with available examples for testing. To verify its version, you can use the `jtop` tool:

1.  **Launch Jtop in your terminal:**
    ```bash
    jtop
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the "7info" tab:**
    Use the right arrow key on your keyboard to select the "7info" section. Here, you will find details about the cuDNN version, as illustrated below:
