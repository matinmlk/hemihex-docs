This guide outlines the initial steps for setting up your Jetson Orin Nano device.

1.  Begin by carefully inserting the pre-imaged Solid State Drive (SSD) into the designated M.2 slot on the Jetson Orin Nano motherboard. Once seated, secure the SSD firmly using the retaining screw.

3.  It is essential to power the Jetson Orin Nano board using the official NVIDIA power supply, which provides 19V 2.37A and features a round-head DC interface. Use of any other power supply is not recommended.

4.  The Jetson Orin Nano will power on automatically upon connection of the official power supply, as there is no dedicated power switch. Observe the DS1 indicator light adjacent to the power input; it should illuminate, confirming power delivery. The system's boot sequence will then be displayed on your connected monitor, progressing until the desktop environment is fully loaded.
